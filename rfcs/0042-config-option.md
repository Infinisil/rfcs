# Summary
[summary]: #summary

A lot of NixOS options exist to specify single settings of configuration files. Along with such options come multiple disadvantages, such as having to synchronize with upstream changes, option bloat and more. An alternative is to provide options for passing the configuration as a string, such as the common `configFile` or `extraConfig` options, but this also comes with a set of disadvantages, including difficulty to override values and bad modularity.

This RFC proposes aims to solve these problems by encouraging NixOS module authors to provide an option for specifying the programs configuration file as a Nix value, providing a set of utility functions for writing these options conveniently, and general guidelines for what justifies a separate option.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

NixOS commonly has 2 models of specifying configuration for programs, each with their own set of problems. This RFC aims to solve all of them.

## Single option for every setting

Having a single option for every setting in the configuration file, this often gets combined with an `extraConfig` option to provide greater flexibility. Problems:

- Coupling to upstream
  - When upstream adds or removes settings, the NixOS module needs to be updated to reflect that.
    - Upstream adds a setting: If the module has an `extraConfig` option people might set the new setting there. But if we ever add it as a NixOS option, we'll have trouble merging the values together with what the user already specified in `extraConfig`
    - Upstream removes a setting (backwards incompatible): The NixOS module is straight up broken in nixpkgs until somebody fixes it, end users can't fix it themselves (unless the module provides a `configFile` option which can override the generated one)
  - The documentation of the upstream settings needs to be copied over to the NixOS options, which means it might get out of sync with changes
  - The upstream defaults are being copied to the NixOS modules, so we need to also update the defaults whenever upstream changes them. This can be solved by using `nullOr` to allow for a `null` value to indicate that the upstream default shall be used, but that's not very nice.
- Option bloat: <s>NixOS evaluation time is still linear in the number of *available* options for all users, even though everybody only uses a fraction of them. This means that when a module adds 100 new options, this leads to a direct increase in evaluation time for every `nixos-rebuild switch` of everybody using NixOS.</s> With high confidence debunked in [#57477](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/57477).
- Timeconsuming to implement, tedious to review and hard to maintain
  - It takes a non-zero amount of time to write all the wanted options out into a NixOS module
  - Reviewing is tedious because people need to make sure types are correct, descriptions are fitting, defaults are acceptable, for every option added. Due to the size and repetitiveness, people are also less willing to thoroughly review the code.
  - The bigger the NixOS module is the harder it is to maintain, and the less people want to actually maintain it. 
- Responsibility for backwards compatibility: By adding such options, we obligate ourselves to handle backwards incompatibilites on our side. We will have to support these options for a long time and can't remove them without at least one person being annoyed about it.

## `configFile` or `extraConfig` option

An option for specifying the contents of the configuration file directly with `configFile` or `extraConfig`. Problems:

- Not very modular at all
  - In case of json or a `configFile` option, you can only assign the option once, merging is impossible
  - In case of ini (or similar), assigning a single option multiple times to make use of list concatenation, ordering or priorities is impossible, so in general you can't e.g. override a default value set somewhere else.
- No syntax checking: Users will have to know the syntax of the configuration language and encode their values properly, any syntax error will only be realized when the program errors at runtime.

## Occurences of problems

- Because prometheus uses options to encode every possible setting, [#56017](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/56017) is needed to allow users to set a part of the configuration that wasn't encoded yet.
- Because strongswan-ctl uses options to encode its full configuration, changes like [#49197](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/49197) are needed to update our options with upstream changes.
- Pull requests like [#57036](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/57036) or [#38324](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/38324) are needed because users wish to have more configuration options than the ones provided.

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

For specifying configuration files to programs in NixOS options, there should be a main single option called `config` which represents the configuration of the program as a Nix value, which can then be converted to the configuration file format the program expects. This may look as follows:

```nix
{ config, lib, ... }: with lib;
let

  cfg = config.services.foo;
  
  # Use port specified in config or the upstream default otherwise
  # Needed to open the correct port
  port = cfg.config.port or 2546;
  
  configText = configGen.json cfg.config;
  
in {

  options.services.foo = {
    enable = mkEnableOption "foo service";
    
    config = mkOption {
      type = lib.types.config.json;
      default = {};
      description = ''
        Configuration for foo. Refer to <link xlink:href="https://example.com/docs/foo"\>
        for documentation on the supported values.
      '';
    };
  };
  
  config = mkIf cfg.enable {
  
    # Set minimal config to get service working by default
    services.foo.config = {
      dataPath = "/var/lib/foo";
      logLevel = mkDefault "WARN";
    };
  
    environment.etc."foo.json".text = configText;
    
    networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ port ];
    # ...
  };
}
```

This approach solves all* of the above mentioned problems. In addition we have the following properties that work with this approach out of the box:
- Ability to easily query arbitrary configuration values with `nix-instantiate --eval '<nixpkgs/nixos>' -A config.services.foo.config`
- The configuration file is well formatted with the right amount of indentation everywhere
- Usually hardcoded defaults can now be replaced by simple assignment of the `config` option, which also allows people to override those values with `mkForce`

*: The only problem it doesn't solve is the coupling to upstream defaults for options that need to be known at evaluation time, such as `port` in the example above, but that's not really avoidable.

### Configuration types

A set of types for common configuration formats should be provided in `lib.types.config`. Such a type should encode what values can be set in files of this configuration format as a Nix value, with the module system being able to merge multiple values correctly. This is the part that checks whether the user set an encodeable value. This can be extended over time, but could include the following as a start:
- JSON
- YAML, which is probably the same as JSON
- INI
- A simple `key=value` format
- A recursive `key.subkey.subsubkey=value` format

Sometimes programs have their own configuration formats, in which case the type should be implemented in the program's module directly.

### Configuration format writers

To convert the Nix value into the configuration string, a set of configuration format writers should be provided under `lib.config`. These should make sure that the resulting text is somewhat properly formatted with readable indentation. These writers will have to include ones for all of the above-mentioned configuration types. As with the type, if the program has its own configuration format, the writer should be implemented in its module directly.

### Documentation

The nixpkgs manual should be updated to recommend this way of doing program configuration in modules, along with examples.

## Limitations

- Limited to configuration file formats representable conveniently in Nix, such as JSON, YAML, INI, key-value files, or similar formats. Examples of unsuitable configuration formats are Haskell, Lisp, Lua or other generic programming languages. For those it is recommended to not hardcode anything and provide a `config` option with type `types.str` or `types.lines` if it makes sense to merge multiple assignments of it.

## Additional config options
Sometimes it makes sense to have an additional NixOS option for a specific configuration setting. In general this should be discussed on a case-by-case basis to judge whether it makes sense. However keep in mind that it's always possible to add more options later on, but you can't as easily remove existing options. Instances of where it can make sense are:
- Settings that are necessary for the module to work and are different for every user, so they can't have a default. Examples are `services.dd-agent.api_key`, `services.davmail.url` or `services.hydra.hydraURL`. Having a separate option for these settings can give a much better error message when you don't set them (instead of failing at runtime or having to encode the requirement in an assertion) and better discoverability.
- Password settings: Some programs configuration files require passwords in them directly. Since we try to avoid having passwords in the Nix store, it is advisable to provide a `passwordFile` option as well, which would replace a placeholder password in the configuration file at runtime.

This `config` approach described here is very flexible for these kind of additions, here's an example where we add a `domain` setting to the above service as a separate NixOS option:
```nix
{ config, lib, ... }: with lib; {

  options.services.foo = {
    # ...
    
    domain = mkOption {
      type = types.str;
      description = "Domain this service operates on.";
    };
  };
  
  config = mkIf cfg.enable {
    services.foo.config = {
      # ...
      domain = mkDefault cfg.domain;
    };
  };
}
```

Even though we have two ways of specifying this configuration setting now, the user is free to choose either way.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

There are some disadvantages to this approach:
- Types of configuration settings can't be checked*, which can lead to packages failing at runtime instead of evaluation time. If the program supports a mode for checking its configuration, this problem can be solved elegantly by using it.
- Documentation for the configuration settings will not be available in the central NixOS manual, instead the upstream documentation has to be used, which can be unfamiliar.

*: It would still be possible to check them by using `types.addCheck` and adjusting the types description, but that sounds more painful than it's worth.
